### Class Overview
-------------------

This is about the Data Analysis Class with The Incubator Hub for the past few months, to acquire additional skills required for Data Analysis, such as Tech skills (Excel, SQL), Data Visualization (Power BI) and Communication Skill (GitHib). 

It was an insightful moment with deep knowledge.  From Basics of Data, to Data Analysis for Data-Driven Decision Making. The class began with MS-EXCEL for data cleaning and reports visualization (tables/charts) using Pivot Tables. Also, writing of queries with SQL. Proceeded further to installation of GitHub and building of a Portfolio. And the class was rounded off with Power BI data entry, connecting with data sources and data visualization.

Data Analysis involves inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modelling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making.
A data is structured in 3 different ways: 
1)	Structured – it is in a table format
2)	Semi-structured – it is not in a table format, but in XML/ISON format
3)	Unstructured – it comes in media form

Data must first be extracted from its source, transform it, and load before it can be restructured for data-driven decision making.
Analysis is beyond visualization. Statistics must come in. Presentation is one of the key things an Analyst does. 
A Data Analyst is a problem-solver. He works with historical data. Every Data Analyst must ensure getting an accurate data for presentation.

### Tools Used
--------------

- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](http://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
 
- SQL - Structured Query Language
  - For Querying of Data
 
- GitHub
  - For Portfolio Building
 
- Power BI
  - For Data Entry/Get Data from Open Sources
  - For Data Transformation
  - For Data Visualization

### Data Cleansing and Preparations
-----------------------------------
- In the initial phase of the Data Cleasing and preparations, we perform the following actions:
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing variables
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
-----------------------------
- EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as:
  1. What is the overall fourth highest salary?
  2. What is the overall third lowest salary?
  3. Which company has the highest salary?
  4. Which company has the lowest salary?

### Data Analysis
-----------------
- This is where we included some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis.
   - Example 1:
   ~~~SQL
   SELECT * FROM TABLE1
   WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
   ~~~

 - Example 2:
   ~~~SQL
   SELECT * FROM TABLE1
   ~~~

 - Example 3:
 ~~~SQL
 SELECT SUM(COLUMN1) AS [ALAS] FROM TABLE1
 ~~~
